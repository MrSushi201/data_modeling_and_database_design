# What do I hope to learn?
I will start of by presenting my background. 
I came from the field of Industrial Design Engineering, and to be honest, I have had hard times finding jobs within that space, partially because of the timing of my graduation. 
So, around the end of the pandemic, I got into an Accelerated Program, offered by a consultancy company/agency here in Sweden, and I learned the basics of Data Engineering with 12-16 weeks. 
The goal for me was to get employment after the graduation. Unluckily for me, I did not get anything. 
So my goal here is to widen my knowledge and interest in the field of Data / Database Engineering. 
Hopefully, I am expecting this course to give me more grounds to stand on, and also the professional certificate that comes with the program will surely help me.
