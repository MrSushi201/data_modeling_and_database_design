# What are tables in databases?
# What is data?

Data refers to the individual (raw) facts, information, or observations that are collected, stored, and processed. It can take various forms, including numbers, text, images, audio, and more. It can be organized (structured) or unorganized (unstructured). Data helps us learn and make decisions. Big data means really large and complex sets of information. Understanding and using data can lead to valuable insights. 

# What is a database?
A database is an organized collection of data, typically stored electronically and systematically. Databases are designed to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. Databases are used in a wide variety of applications, including e-commerce, banking, and healthcare. There are many different types of databases, but they all share some common features.

## Most common types of databases
1. Relational databases - store data in tables or entities, and each table has a set of columns that represent the different attributes of data.
2. NoSQL databases - designed to store and manage unstructured (unorganized) data. 
3. Columnar databases (a type of NoSQL database) - designed to store data in columns rather than rows. 
    - Columnar databases store data by organizing it vertically, where each column holds data for specific attribute or field. This is different from traditional row-based databases where each row contains all the information for an individual entry. So, in a columnar DBMS, the data would be stored in the following manner:
    1, 2, 3; Supachok, Santi, Siriwan; Taweesamarn, Taweesamarn, Taweesamarn; 32, 28, 27;
    1, Supachok, Taweesamarn, 32; 2, Santi, Taweesamarn, 28; 3, Siriwan, Taweesamarn, 27;

# How are databases

managed?

Databases are managed by database management system (DBMS). DBMSs are software programs that provide a set of tools for creating, accessing, and manipulating data in a database. Think of it like a digital librarian that helps organize and control data. DBMSs typically support a variety of features, such as the ability to:

- Define the structure of a database, including the tables, columns, and data types.
- Create and modify data in a database.
- Retrieve data from a database.
- Secure a database from unauthorized access.
- Enforce data integrity, which means that the data in a database is accurate and consistent.

A database can be hosted on a dedicated machine on-site. It can also be hosted on the cloud, and these are typically called cloud databases. Cloud databases are becoming popular because they are easy to manage and scale, and they can be accessed from anywhere.

# How is data related?

Data stored in a database cannot exist in isolation. Data is/can be related in a number of ways. Data in a database is organized into tables, where each table represents a specific entity or group of related data. These tables are linked together through relationships, which define how the data in each table connects to the data in other tables. In other words, the key to establishing data relationships lies in the concept of primary keys and foreign keys. A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring data integrity. A foreign key, on the other hand, references the primary key of another table, forming a link between the two. 

## Types of relationships

1. One-to-One - A relationship where each record in one table can be related to one and only one record in another table. 
2. One-to-Many - A relationship where each record in one table can be related to zero, one, or many records in another table. 
3. Many-to-Many - A relationship where multiple records in one table can be related to multiple records in another table. This relationship is typically implemented using a third table called a “junction table” to maintain the relationships. 

# What are tables in databases?

In the context of databases, a table is a data structure that organizes information into rows and columns. It is the fundamental structure used to store and manage data in a relational database management system (RDBMS). Examples of database management systems that use tables include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite. Here are some key concepts related to tables in databases:

- Rows (Records) - An instance of the data that contains a set of related data fields.
- Columns (Fields) - Attributes of the data. They define the types of data that can be stored.
- Primary Key - A unique identifier for each record in a table. PK ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and distinguishes one record one record from another. PK is often used to establish relationships between tables or entities.
- Foreign Key - A column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between two tables and is used to enforce referential integrity.
- Data Types - Each column in a table is assigned a specific data type. This helps define the kind of data that can be stored in the column.
- Table Relationships - In relational databases, tables can be related to each other through keys.
- Normalization - The process of organizing the data in the database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down tables into smaller, more manageable structures while maintaining the relationships between them.
- Data Manipulation Language - Tables support DML operations. These operations allow users to retrieve, add, modify, or delete data from the tables.

## Tables overview
A table is the most basic type of database object in relational databases. It is responsible for storing data in the database. A database table consists of rows and columns. Just like in a spreadsheet of data, there are rows that run horizontally. These rows represent each record. Rows in turn span multiple columns. Columns run vertically. They are like the definition of each field. Each column has a name and a data type that describe the data that is stored in it. 
Every column in a table has a data type. These data types are defined by SQL or Structured Query Language. A data type defines the type of value that can be stored in a table column. 
For example, here are some of the data types that are available:
- Numeric data types such as INT, TINYINT, BIGINT, FLOAT, REAL.
- Date and time data types such as DATE, TIME, DATETIME.
- Character and string data types such as CHAR, VARCHAR.
- Binary data types such as BINARY, VARBINARY.
- Miscellaneous data types such as:
    - Character Large Object (CLOB) for storing a large block of text in some form of text encoding.
    - Binary Large Object (BLOB) for storing a collection of binary data such as images.

### Tables in a relational database
In a relational database, there are multiple tables representing the structure of the backend of a software system. In relational database terminology, a table is also known as a relation or entity. A table row or a record is also known as a tuple. Each table or relation in a database has its own schema. Schema simply means the structure. The structure includes:
- The name of the table or relation.
- Its attributes.
- Their names.
- Data types.

### Primary Key and Foreign Key
In a table, there is a field or column that is known as a key, which can uniquely identify a particular tuple (row) in a relation (table). This key is known as a primary key. In some cases, the primary key can comprise more than one column or field. This happens when a single column cannot make a record in a table uniquely identifiable. However, two or more columns can make a record unique. Therefore, the primary key that comprises of multiple columns is also known as a composite primary key.
Tables in a database do not stay isolated from each other. They need to have relationships between them. Tables are linked with one another through a key column (primary key) of one table that is also present in the related table as a foreign key.

### Integrity constraints
Every table in a database should abide by rules or constraints. These are known as integrity constraints. There are three main integrity constraints:
- Key constraints - There should be one or more columns that can be used to fetch data from tables. This key attribute or primary key should never be NULL, or the same for two different rows of data.
- Domain constraints - Refer to the rules defined for the values that can be stored for a certain column. For example, you cannot store the home address of a student in the first name column. Similarly, a contact number cannot exceed a certain amount of digits.
- Referential integrity constraints - When a table is related to another table via a foreign key column, then the referenced column value must exist in the other table.
