# Intro to SQL

## What is Structured Query Language?
Structured Query Language or SQL, is a portable and standard language that can be used to interact with relational/structured data on databases. 
SQL, or Structured Query Language, uses a specific set of commands to interact with a database through the use of RDBMS (Relational Database Management System).
SQL databases come in a number of forms, such as Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. 
It includes the use of keyword-like statements to accomplish several tasks.
The tasks can be creating, deleting, or modifying tables, retrieving, inserting, or modifying data. 

## SQL usage
SQL is the most used database query language. It is designed for retrieving and managing data in a relational database.
SQL can be used to perform different types of operations in the database such as accessing data, describing data, manipulating data, and setting users roles and privileges.
Here, we will learn about the main commands used in SQL. The SQL commands are grouped into four categories:
- Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Data Control Language (DCL)
- Transaction Control Language (TCL)

### Data Definition Language (DDL)
The SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) category provides commands for defining, deleting, and modifying tables in a database.
- CREATE Command - To create the database or tables inside the database. 
    ```sql
    -- Syntax to create a table with three columns
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
        column_name1 datatype(size), 
        column_name2 datatype(size), 
        column_name3 datatype(size)
    );
    ```
- DROP Command - To delete a database or a table inside the database.
    ```sql
    -- Syntax to drop a table
    DROP TABLE table_name;
    ```
- ALTER Command - To change the structure of the tables in the database such as changing the name of a table, adding a primary key to a table, or adding or deleting a column in a table.
    ```sql
    -- Syntax to add a column into a table
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD (column_name datatype(size));
    ```
    ```sql
    -- Syntax to add a primary key to a table
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD primary key (column_name);
    ```
- TRUNCATE Command - To remove all records from a table, which will empty the table but not delete the table itself.
    ```sql
    -- Syntax to truncate a table
    TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
    ```

### Data Query Language (DQL)
The SQL Data Query Language (DQL) category provides the ability to query and retrieve data from the database. 
- SELECT Command - To retrieve data from tables in the database. 
    ```sql
    -- Syntax to select data from a table
    SELECT * 
    FROM table_name;
    ```

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
The SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) category provides the ability to query, delete, and update data in the database. 
- INSERT Command - To add records of data into an existing table.
    ```sql
    -- Syntax to insert data into three columns in a table.
    INSERT INTO table_name
        (column_name1, column_name2, column_name3)
    VALUES
        (value1, value2, value3);
    ```
- UPDATE Command - To modify or update data contained within a table in the database.
    ```sql
    -- Syntax to update data in two columsn
    UPDATE table_name
    SET
        column_name1 = value1,
        column_name2 = value2,
    WHERE condition;
    ```
- DELETE Command - To delete data from a table in the database
    ```sql
    -- Syntax to delete data
    DELETE FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```

### Data Control Language (DCL)
The SQL Data Control Language (DCL) category is used for dealing with the rights and permissions of users of a database system. 
You can execute SQL commands to perform different types of operations such as create and drop tables. 
To do this, you need to have user rights set up. This is called user privileges. This category deals with advanced functions or operations in the database. 
Note that this category can have a generic description of the two main commands. 
- GRANT Command - To provide the user of the database with the privileges required to allow users to access and manipulate the database.
- REVOKE Command - To remove permissions from any user. 

### Transaction Control Language (TCL)
The Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands are used to manage transactions in the database. 
These are used to manage the changes made to the data in a table by utilizing the DML commands.
It also allows SQL statements to be grouped together into logical transactions.
Note that this category can have a generic description of the two main commands. 
- COMMIT Command - To save all the work you have already done in the database.
- ROLLBACK Command - To restore a database to the last committed state.
